# portscan2
#this program has 3 options and an end command.
#When you start the python script you will be given 4 options.
#option 1 is a traceroute, it will have you put in your target host.
#option 2 is a portscan, it will ask for the host ip and prot number, it will then print out any open ports.
#option 3 does the same thing as option 2 put it saves the output to an html file in the same directory.
#end will exit the program.
#this was tested and coded in kali linux.
